<p>Notes on perspective. 1-point perspective is easily prone to distortion. As an approximation, we assume the camera is really far away, and limit ourselves to less than ~50deg of FOV for the least amount of distortion. For 2 or 3 point perspective, 60deg of FOV is acceptable. In 4 point perspective, we are a cylinder. In 5 point perspective, we can achieve 180 deg FOV without distortion (that's half of a sphere, basically), and in 6 point perspective, we grow eyes on the back of our head and see 360deg without distortion.</p>
<p>4 point continous looks like this: S-E-N-W-S. By the same measure, it is possible to have 4, 5, 6, 7 vanishing points, although we quickly leave the realm of reality by then.</p>
